I'm a fourth year Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](http://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My advisor is [Zhan Li](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/lizhan?lang=en). 

I work in birational geometry, especially the minimal model program. I am studying the Kawamata-Morrison cone conjecture.
